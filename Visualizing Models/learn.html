    <h3>Learn Shapes</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The shape can be defined as the boundary or outline of an object. It is the surface we see and does not depend on the size or the color
        Everything around us has a different shape, such as the square, rectangle, or sphere.

    <h4>Circle</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">
         A circle is a shape that is made up of a curved line.
        It's round, and all points on the curved line are an equal distance from the center point.
        This shape is two-dimensional, which means it's flat.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">

        A cylinder is round and has a top and bottom in the shape of a circle.
